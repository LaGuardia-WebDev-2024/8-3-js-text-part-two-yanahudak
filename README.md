## Directions

### Step #1 - Follow the mouse with the pink ball! <br>

To start our mouse tracking program, make it so that the `ellipse()` shows up at the user's mouse position, instead of always being in the same position.
<br><br>
Hint: Use the `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables to position your ellipse.
<br><br>

### Step #2 - Display the coordinates! <br>

To make this tracker more useful, you're going to constantly display a label with the current x and y mouse coordinates next to the dot. To do that:
<br>
- Add together `mouseX`, a string with a comma, and `mouseY`; Store as a variable
> `var label = XXXX + " , " + XXXXX;`

- Pass the variable into the text command and show it next to the ball.
> `text(label, XXXX, XXXX)`
<br><br>

### Step #3 - Add a feature! <br>

Try to add one of the following extra features to this lesson: 
<br>
- Change Color Based on mouseX and mouseY [Example Code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CBxJdV9EW1gLmR3ZAtA_Etil6GiPvKhSNLmE5Wq63k/edit#slide=id.g2d8681d0968_0_12)
- Change Font [Example Code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CBxJdV9EW1gLmR3ZAtA_Etil6GiPvKhSNLmE5Wq63k/edit#slide=id.g2d87d56757f_1_138)
